# Automated NPM Publishing and GitHub Release Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically:
# 1. Runs when you push a version tag (e.g., v4.0.1, v4.1.0)
# 2. Publishes the package to npm registry using Trusted Publisher (OIDC)
# 3. Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes
#
# How to trigger:
#   npm version patch  # Bumps version and creates tag
#   git push origin master --follow-tags
#
# Requirements:
#   - Trusted Publisher (OIDC) configured on npm (✅ Already set up!)
#   - No NPM_TOKEN needed - authentication is automatic via OIDC
